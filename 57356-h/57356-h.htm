<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>HE <i>raison d’être</i> of this small work was suggested to me at the time
of the lamented death of King Edward of happy memory. I essayed to mark
the date of his decease by writing a few lines in commemoration of the
event, and from that time forward I have felt a desire to express my
thoughts in verse, with the hope that Queenslanders, no less than
others, may see beauty in everything God has made. I am conscious there
are many defects, and ask the leniency of my readers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would here acknowledge the kindness and courtesy of “The Brisbane
Courier” for the production of my efforts in their valuable journal,
which encourages me to trust that some little pleasure may be derived
from their perusal. Such is the earnest wish of the Authoress.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_HAUNTED_CHAIR" id="THE_HAUNTED_CHAIR"></a>THE HAUNTED CHAIR.</h3>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">One of a large house party, on a frosty Christmas Eve,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The conversation led to ghosts in which some folks believe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“I wish this house were haunted,” cried a lady young and gay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“I’d shut myself within its gloom, and none should say me nay.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our host informed us gravely that up the broad oak stair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was a sealed and disused chamber, which owned a haunted chair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His grandfather long years before was missing from his bed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They searched and found him sitting within the arm-chair&mdash;dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His wealth had been proverbial, but no one found a will;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And though in manner sometimes strange, no one had wished him ill.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“The secret never had been solved,” our host said, “nor a trace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of ought remained, except the land, and this ancestral place.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“<span class="lftspc">’</span>Tis done,” the lady said; “to-night I sleep in that arm-chair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“And if his ghost appears to me, I’ll never show my fear.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That night the lady went and sat within the chamber dim;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She drew the curtain, chose a book, and read a Christmas hymn.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_21" id="page_21">{21}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then a fear possessed her, she grasped the huge arm-chair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For in the shadows she could see a man with whitened hair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hands were clasped above him in suppliant attitude.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tears were streaming down like rain, while words in torrent flowed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“I had a brother once, a boy. I loved him as my life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he destroyed my happiness, he stole my promised wife.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We parted, he to Austral’s land, I for long years to mourn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until his widow sought me out to aid her infant son.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We married, and I brought him up, but he my wealth desired;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I hid it here, for of this youth with fear was I inspired.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who’er shall find this secret, as my will doth so declare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall take the half, and all the rest the poor shall have a share;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Christ reward the hand that finds, and does this Christian deed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For He hath said unto His flock, “See that my lambs ye feed.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She rose with awe, he beckoned her, the chair began to creak;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He pressed two large brass nails which lay beneath the leather back.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there inside the haunted chair were heaps and heaps of gold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And papers tied with tapes, and strings, and dusty parchments old.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_22" id="page_22">{22}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her dream she told that Christmas morn, the haunted chair was brought&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fearful weight it was to move, ’twas well and truly wrought&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length with pressure brought to bear the nails began to move.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When there disclosed to light of day, lay the old man’s treasure-trove.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lady won’t believe in ghosts, but she believes in dreams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And also that this lovely world is better than it seems.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To-day we are the owners of the ancient haunted chair&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And clasping Christmas presents my wife is seated there.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">How well I remember the tranquil hours<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We spent in the haunted wood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How fair was the glade and the primrose flowers<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where the ruined abbey stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For there, near the lake where water springs&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It gushed in a crystal stream&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the mouth of a dragon with carven wings<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And eyes of a fearful gleam.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there was the grotto, with walls inlet<br /></span>

<span class="i2">The leaves by the wind were stirred.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For ages and ages ago ’twas said<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A prince of the Saxon blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the Lady Osyth one day was wed<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By a priest of the holy rood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He bade adieu at the altar there,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But alas, for the vows they made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A rival prince took his bride so fair<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By force to the forest shade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She was rescued, assuming the sacred veil,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And a nun she had scarce been made,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_88" id="page_88">{88}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">When up to the abbey, in coat of mail,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Rode the prince with a gleaming blade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with sword held high he espied the face<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of his wife in a window near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A moment more, in his fast embrace<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Swooned the lady in deadly fear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fast on his palfrey they rode away<br /></span>
<span class="i2">These twain through the woodland deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saw not the rival till brought to bay<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Near the “Fatal Lover’s Leap.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the enemy’s knights came and bore them on<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And round to the moonlit lake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And jeered: “So perish each wicked one<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who is false to the vows they make.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The prince they bound to his steed and led<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The lady whose every limb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trembled, while faltering prayers she said<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And her glorious eyes grew dim.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then they bade her stand by the dragon’s side<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When with swift and sudden blow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rapier fell, and her life’s red tide<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Welled o’er to the stream below.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the legend runs that the headless form<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of the maiden quickly bent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lifted her head beneath her arm<br /></span>
<span class="i2">While a shriek the wild echoes rent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the prince enraged, when he knew her fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Unbuckled his heavy mail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, stabbing himself as his steed he sate,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He died with a mournful wail.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the story goes that the lady’s shade<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Still walks, and her voice is heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the moon is old in the haunted glade&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Like the cry of a wounded bird<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_89" id="page_89">{89}</a></span>&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the headless image in marble chased<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of this saint in the chancel old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still stands, though time hath its lines effaced<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And despoiled it of beauty’s mould.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And oft as I think of the woodland fair<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the legend, I fain would be<br /></span>

<h3><a name="SCENTS_AND_THE_PAST" id="SCENTS_AND_THE_PAST"></a>SCENTS AND THE PAST.<br /><br />
<small>A STRONG CONNECTING LINK.</small></h3>

<p>It sometimes happens that some uncommon perfume will carry us back to
the days of our girlhood, when our mothers would devoutly disclose to
the light of day all sorts of odd things, such as old letters smelling
of musk, or ribbons and pieces of old lace yellow with age, cast off
baby clothes, which once on a time, covered our tiny persons, little
pinafores or caps and booties, perhaps toys which once belonged to a
sister or brother, long since gone on the other side.</p>

<p>Again, such a perfume may remind us of a time when the whole family were
gathered around the festive board, laughing, bright with repartee, the
room redolent of fragrance from the tastefully arranged flowers, long
since forgotten. Somehow a scent brings back a flood of memories; the
scene; the very arch glance of a pair of eyes, or the grave sweet look
of a face, as though it were yesterday.</p>

<p>Some perfumes become a precious memory lying dormant, which one can
conjure up at will. Others are suddenly resurrected.</p>

<p>Lavender! What luxury to lie between sheets odorous of lavender. And the
old-fashioned potpourri of late years, having a revival of favour,
chiefly consisting of orris roots, violets and rose leaves&mdash;with sweet
thoughts centred and clinging around them. The roses!</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza90">
<span class="i0">Goddess of beauty, at thy magic breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My spirit turneth from the gate of death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in thy deep red heart would find repose.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dreams of Arcady&mdash;thou queenly rose!<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_93" id="page_93">{93}</a></span></div></div>
</div>

<p>And, talking of roses, what a lot of them are now being worn on the
hats. Never in the history or vagaries of fashion have flowers held such
pride of place as at present. And, although they are artificial, they
revive thoughts of perfume. Some of the models make us think of Watteau
shepherdesses as the right sort of beauties to wear them; but some of
our Queensland girls have faces pretty and artistic enough to grace
anything with advantage.</p>

<p>I heard a very pretty compliment paid to Queensland women as a whole the
other day by an English gentleman. He remarked (I hope my readers will
not become too vain after hearing this) that they are the neatest and
nicest dressed girls he had seen anywhere, and were an example&mdash;with the
exception of some over-dressed ones&mdash;to many English women. But to
return to our own “moutons.”</p>

<p>How the smell of very old furniture will make one’s memory retrace its
steps. The past stands out sadly or joyously, and sometimes it is so
subtle and suggestive as to convey one back to a confused memory, like a
thread of a pre-existence, which most of us have experienced. It is very
vague and uncertain. Yet there it is.</p>

<p>Yes! scents are strong connecting links between the past and present,
and we have a sense of gratitude, for it gives us something very
pleasant to think about&mdash;and sometimes has the charm of making our
existence free from feelings of ennui.</p>

<h3><a name="MALTA" id="MALTA"></a>MALTA.<br /><br />
<small>JUST A GLIMPSE.</small></h3>

<p>It had been a very rough passage through the Bay of Biscay, and it was
an immense relief to run into calm water, so, hugging the coast of
southern Spain, we could distinctly see the shore, with trees standing
out in bold relief against the sky. So (I shall never as long as I live
forget the beauty of the scene) we approached the great, brown rock of
Gibraltar, with its hundred eyes of hate, bristling with guns, and with
the now fashionable watering place of Algiers on our left, we passed
through the great “Pillars of Hercules,” the extremities of Europe and
Africa almost meeting into the Mediterranean. The passage appears much
narrower than it really is, sea distance being deceptive. We steamed
along in the pinken glow of dawn, the change being very pleasant, and
the air gradually becoming warmer, until within a few miles of Malta
(which island, as you know, is off the southern coast of Sicily), when
it suddenly became quite hot. And, how shall I describe the impression,
under perfect weather conditions? The white rock, so imposing and
important politically, as well as commercially. A jewelled island, set
in a sapphire sea. A green vista of terraces of white houses, with green
shutters and awnings of scarlet and white, flapping in the breeze.
Pedestrians we could see in the distance with the ubiquitous umbrellas
and hats, green lined to keep off the glare of the sun. Presently we
anchored, and, hey presto! we were almost immediately surrounded by
vendors of all sorts of things in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_95" id="page_95">{95}</a></span> shape of coral earrings,
bracelets, and brooches, good and bad Florida water, perfumes, real
Maltese lace and bad imitation. We inspected their wares, and amid a
babel of French and Italian (we being in a hurry), we purchased some
good lace and eau de Cologne.</p>

<p>Then, we decided we would go ashore, which three of us did, and we
passed the casinos and shipping offices, and wended our way up those
famous streets of stairs described by Lord Byron, and we no longer
wondered, when we thought of his poor deformed foot, how difficult he
must have found the ascent. Each house rose imperially above its
neighbour up those flights, and, peeping from some of the doors, were
dark-eyed Madonna-looking Spanish beauties, their classic heads draped
gracefully with mantillas. But the dominating smell, which spoilt it
all, was that of garlic. It assailed our nostrils; it seemed to be
everywhere, and we were told that, in some form or another, it was found
at every meal. At last we gained the top, after much stifled laughter,
and made for the barracks and the fort, after which we visited the
armoury, and imagined we had known the brave knights themselves, after
the kind information tendered by our guide in mixed Anglo-Saxon, French
and Italian.</p>

<p>We then went to the Cathedral of St. John, saw the Alexandrian Gate, and
the places set apart for worshippers of different sects, after which we
joined in a service in the central portion. Later on towards sunset, we
hired a fiacre with a Pegasus-like winged steed attached, and the way
that sorry horse flew along was marvellous. No whip was needed, and to
say he was as thin as a herring<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_96" id="page_96">{96}</a></span> would be a libel on the herring.
Anyhow, we arrived safely at Valetta, the Government residence, and
visited the famous orange gardens. We returned to the ship, dined on
board, and then in the evening went toiling up again to the Royal Opera
House. The scene was very brilliant. An Italian Company was performing,
and the artistes were loaded with floral tributes. The next day we were
off again, and steamed to Cape Malea&mdash;but “that’s another story.”</p>

<p class="c"><img src="images/knot.png"

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_97" id="page_97">{97}</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="SMYRNA" id="SMYRNA"></a>SMYRNA.</h3>

<p>It was a glorious morning when we arrived off Malea, and we steamed near
enough to distinguish the plateau on the rock where the celebrated old
hermit&mdash;who isolated himself in that lonely spot for so many years&mdash;had
always, on the approach of a vessel, advanced waving a flag.</p>

<p>The promontory passed, we were out of the Mediterranean, and we slowly
passed the maze of islands&mdash;the Cyclades&mdash;past Milo and Delos, famed in
song and story, Andros and Nicaria, and soon were making our way into
the Ægean Sea towards the volcanic island of Chios or Cos. This island
is off the Gulf of Smyrna, and has frequently been devastated by seismic
agencies.</p>

<p>It was a thrilling experience passing through the Gulf, and there, in
the light of evening, lay that ancient city&mdash;one of the seven Churches
of Asia&mdash;with its background of everlasting hills, beneath a turquoise
sky, carrying one’s mind back down the centuries, when St. Paul himself
preached there, and delivered the message to the churches.</p>

<p>Smyrna is the key of Asia Minor, and Anatolia is as large as France.</p>

<p>After our luggage had been inspected, we, after some altercation with
the drivers of various vehicles, were driven to our hotel, and, after
divesting ourselves of our travelling attire, we descended to the
table-d’-hôte, where dinner was served à la Russe. We noted the many
little dishes filled, one for each guest, with black and green olives,
and fresh beady-looking black caviare, the roe of the sturgeon,
indigenous to the Black Sea.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_98" id="page_98">{98}</a></span></p>

<p>It was a truly cosmopolitan company which sat down to dine&mdash;so many
nationalities being represented&mdash;for Smyrna to-day is a very large and
important city of the near east.</p>

<p>The caravans leave here for the desert with all sorts of merchandise,
and they bring ivory, spices, and precious stones in return. The culture
of silk is carried on to an enormous extent, and the figs are of an
immense size. We watched, the day after our arrival, the loading of the
camels for the desert. Some looked well, others as though they would not
reach the end of the journey. Smyrna is the rendezvous of every eastern
merchant. The Armenians being good linguists, they conduct the bulk of
the business for the Turks, and are tutors in wealthy households.</p>

<p>The Angora goats and the Asiatic sheep&mdash;with tremendous tails, weighing
ten and fifteen pounds&mdash;flourish here in great numbers. We drove to the
Church of St. John some miles away. The scenery was truly magnificent,
and we felt that Turkey possessed the garden of the gods. We passed
pretty villas, buried in a wealth of magnolia trees, but the cypress
trees predominate, and the mulberry is very plentiful. We visited the
church, but were very much disappointed, the pictures being very tawdry
and common.</p>

<p>We also visited the ruins at Ephesus, to which we went by a slow train.
Frequent earthquakes have laid everything in magnificent ruin&mdash;remains
of ampitheatres, temples, aqueducts, are all levelled to the ground.
Most of the houses are built of wood which give in seismic shocks, but
the facades are of marble.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_99" id="page_99">{99}</a></span></p>

<p>The Hamals are wonderfully strong, short but active men, and carry
immense loads upon their backs, the veins in their legs looking like
ropes. These are all Armenians and are trained from infancy.</p>

<p>We visited the Bazaar and the Turkish quarter, but were glad to escape
the dust and the quaint species of humanity.</p>

<hr style="width: 5%;" />

<p>It may not be uninteresting reading now that the papers are filled with
news of the war between the allies and Turkey, if I recall one of the
pleasantest and most exciting days I ever spent during my sojourn in the
Ottoman Empire. I would first of all remark, that Turkey occupies the
most beautiful portion of Europe. The soil, being so volcanic, produces
a wealth of luxurious fruits, especially grapes and figs; but the
Turkish Government, as well as the Turks themselves, being naturally
indolent, never think of cultivating the soil as they might. Therefore,
there is more poverty among them, through their laxity, than wealth.</p>

<p>The part of Turkey in which I happened to have recently arrived was the
lovely island of Lesbos, the birthplace of Sappho, and with very mixed
feelings have I stood on the very spot on the road to Polyknito, where
that impulsive maid so long ago threw herself from that Leucadian steep
into the blue waters beneath. Of recent years, a young lady I knew,
threw herself from the same spot and perished&mdash;a victim of unrequited
love.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_100" id="page_100">{100}</a></span></p>

<p>Well, two or three Greek girl friends and myself made up our minds to
have a real good day’s outing, so, packing our luncheon baskets, we were
off before sunrise, as, living some distance from the town of Mitylene,
we had a long walk in front of us. We started in high spirits, and were
nearing the town when I heard what, to my unsophisticated ears, was a
most peculiar awe-inspiring sound. I found it was produced by the Hozahs
at sunrise, calling from the minarets of the mosques, the faithful to
prayer. And Turks they may be, but, they shame us by their devotions,
which all the jeers in the world would never prevent.</p>

<p>We toiled along up the hill towards the Konah, the kiosk, being near by
the Governor’s residence, and at the top we stood admiring the sunrise
over the hills of Anatolia, in Asia Minor; and the view right along to
the heights of Smyrna in the distance was superb. Every inch of this
part of eastern Europe is teeming with historical interest. We walked
along past the Turkish graveyard, the tombs of which are all surmounted
with turbans beautifully sculptured, giving in the dusk a most weird
appearance, as though human beings stood there on guard.</p>

<p>At length we arrived at the Loutra, as it is called. The thermal water
is conducted underground from the hot springs. We entered a small garden
enclosed by a wall; then we were ushered into a room containing dozens
of small cupboard-like compartments, scrupulously clean. Our entrance
fee was five piasters, or tenpence in English money. We were each
supplied with clean towels. Then I, at least, went timorously towards
the apartment where<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_101" id="page_101">{101}</a></span> the first portion of our ablutions were to be
carried out. An attendant came forward to receive us. The first
apartment was very warm, and we remained there until the perspiration
began to trickle down on to our towels which we secured round our
waists. Then came the ordeal.</p>

<p>On entering the “chamber of horrors” (I thought at first) I could
scarcely breathe, the air was so hot, and then I noticed that the floor
in this dome-shaped chamber sloped towards the middle. Suddenly several
taps were turned on, gently at first, and the attendant smeared us all
over the top part of our bodies with Fuller’s earth, after which, the
taps were turned on full speed, and we raced round that room while the
attendants pursued us, and smacked us soundly in turn. We slid around on
the marble floor, but kept losing our footing. Our faces were scarlet,
and oh! the dirt that came from the pores of our skin. And we had
thought we were clean! Well, the smacking process went on; the water
seemed hotter than ever, and at last we were allowed into the cooler
chamber, as we were feeling exhausted. The attendant was a Turkish
woman, but spoke Greek sufficiently to make herself understood. I have
often thought since she was an unusually active person for a Turkish
woman.</p>

<p>Then we went back to the dressing rooms again, and after we had rested
on one of the numerous divans for half-an-hour, we went into the garden
and eat our dejeuner with gusto, we were so hungry and so delightfully
tired; and we chatted and watched the groups of well-to-do people
enjoying themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_102" id="page_102">{102}</a></span>&mdash;the Turkish children, in particular, with dozens
upon dozens of small plaits adorning their heads, which are often not
undone for months.</p>

<p>At 4 o’clock small cups of muddy, but delicious mocha were brought us,
and then we regretfully departed for our tramp home after a very
pleasant day, almost too fatigued to talk. So ended my first day in a
Turkish bath, for it needs the whole day to recuperate after the trying
but pleasing experience.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_PORTS_OF_PALESTINE" id="THE_PORTS_OF_PALESTINE"></a>THE PORTS OF PALESTINE.</h3>

<p>One morning we were waiting, luggage packed ready, to embark on the
Russian liner for all Palestine Ports. We were in a state of suppressed
excitement at the alluring prospects in store for us, the historical
places, and scenic loveliness of which we had heard, making us long to
start. After some hours the belated vessel hove in sight, an immense
grey object, capable of carrying in comfort eight or nine hundred
passengers. Having previously secured our ticket, we immediately hired a
caique, after much altercation about the fare, and were speedily
conveyed to the vessel, which was making only a short stay. Arrived on
board, we were conducted by a gorgeously dressed official to our cabin,
and delivered to the tender mercies of the stewardess, a French woman.
We went on deck to explore, and until we started people were rushing
about talking in a dozen different languages. At last we were off, and
we took our final farewell of Smyrna, that peerless city of the East,
set in the beautiful background of opaline-tinted clouds, merging into
crimson departing glory of day; and at last, as the pall of night fell,
we went into the saloon&mdash;which was filled with the usual brilliant
company of tourists&mdash;to dine. After dinner, tea, instead of coffee, was
served in long fragile glasses, a thin slice of lemon floating on top,
and a serviette to prevent the fingers being burned. Of pale amber
colour this tea was delicious, the flavour exquisitely preserved. The
tea is imported overland, the sea voyage destroying the flavour more or
less.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_104" id="page_104">{104}</a></span></p>

<p>We again went on deck and, glancing beneath us on the lower deck, we saw
long rows of reclining figures in white, like so many mummies, with one
or two sitting up talking volubly and gesticulating. They were Turks and
Arabs bound for Bagdad and Mecca. There were long-bearded Greek priests,
Armenians, Italians, and Russians, all en route to Jerusalem or
Damascus, the majority for Jerusalem. They would return as Hadjes, a
title which is borne by those who have visited the Holy Sepulchre.</p>

<p>We were up very early to see the first beams of Aurora, and we were well
rewarded, earth and sea combining to make one feel how beautiful it is
to live. The mysterious beauty of the misty mitre-peaked hills on the
land side of us, rosy in the gilded dawn, filled our minds with
imagination. On the other side, gleaming like the facets of an emerald,
lay Samos, noted for its vintage, its figs and oil, the dark olive
mounts, showing against the tender foliage of orange and lemon groves.
On we went until we came to Rhodes, with its great harbour, once famed
for its colossus erected to Apollo, but long since levelled to the
ground by seismic agencies. It must have appeared like a mighty janitor
watching down the centuries, worshipped as a deity by the wonderful race
who lived there.</p>

<p>We chummed with five young Russian ladies, who, with their chaperon,
were journeying to the Holy Sepulchre, and we were shown the presents of
silver and crosses which they were to lay on the shrine. We extracted
much pleasure from their company, and we would not like to disclose how
many cups of tea we consumed from the ever-boiling<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_105" id="page_105">{105}</a></span> samovar, which these
ladies dispensed every time they could induce us to visit the cabin de
luxe reserved for their special use. They will always hold a place in
our memory.</p>

<p>On leaving Rhodes, we steamed away from the coast and we turned in
towards Cyprus, passing the Gulf of Adalia. The Island of Cyprus is
noted for its ancient copper mines, its magnificent temples, statues to
the deities, and frescoes covered with the dust of centuries. From there
we made for the mainland, remaining at the small town of Alexandretta
but a few hours. Everything was extremely Oriental. We saw a number of
Mohammaden women, attended by an eunuch, walking along, their yasmaks
now and again lowered, and a pair of laughing young eyes disclosed. How
the dark eyes, some very dreamy looking, of these wise children of the
East (some of them the Bedouin Arabs, the descendants of Ishmael) have
been, century after century, centred on these Eastern nights of
splendour, watching the heavens&mdash;wiser than we in things pertaining to
nature.</p>

<p>We next come to Tripoli, with its long-robed bearded priests and sheiks,
and veiled women, and the dogs, those scavengers of the east, the
bazaars, and beautiful foliage.</p>

<p>When we came to Beyrout there was a great stir, so many persons
disembarking, some for Beyrout, but more bent for Damascus, beyond the
Mountain of Lebanon, and some crossing the Syrian deserts for Bagdad. We
bought some immense bunches of pink, blue and white double violets which
came from Sharon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_106" id="page_106">{106}</a></span></p>

<p>Damascus, the oldest city in the world, is famed chiefly for its finely
wrought steel instruments in the shape of swords, daggers, knives,
stilettos, some of them magnificent specimens of artistic skill, and
often encrusted with jewels of great value.</p>

<p>After leaving Beyrout the weather began to get very stormy, the waves
grew mountainous, and soon we were in the throes of a great gale. Just
about here we were told the currents are very dangerous, and very fierce
storms rage at times. We were ordered below, and we could hear glass and
crockery breaking at intervals&mdash;during a lull of the tempest.</p>

<p>When morning broke we were some miles from Joppa or Jaffa, as it is
called to-day. As we slowly neared the port, rolling heavily, we saw
that ancient city built on a rock rising sheer out of the water, with
practically no harbour, and in that great gale, swarms of caiques manned
by dexterous men of divers nationalities coming towards us&mdash;one moment
lost in the waves, the next high up on the crest of another. It was of
no use, we could not cast anchor, and were doomed to disappointment, for
had we not dreamed of traversing that long, white, chalky road which
some forty miles away shows the Zion of the elect. And our Russian
ladies were greatly excited at having to wait until the return voyage to
descend and attain their heart’s desire&mdash;to say that they had seen
Gethsemane, Calvary, and all the places which must, in these modern
times, have lost (except the Holy Sepulchre) much of the beauty depicted
in holy writ.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_IVORY_TEMPLE" id="THE_IVORY_TEMPLE"></a>THE IVORY TEMPLE.<br /><br />
<small>FOR AUSTRALIAN WOMEN.</small></h3>

<p>No matter to what status of society we belong we nearly all have little
idiosyncrasies, little mannerisms, and, in the majority of cases, they
are caused by self-consciousness. Many great speakers, at times, show it
in a marked degree. Actresses, too, suffer from it, not to mention
singers; but in the latter cases it is termed stage fright. And it is
not vanity, it is hyper-sensitiveness; it is not unpardonable, but is
often adversely criticised.</p>

<p>And how often are we prone to criticise our friends in their absence;
when they are not present to refute any unkind thing said of them,
merely because they are misunderstood. The things said may be very
trivial, and a look or an innuendo will ban more than words. How often
are long and valued friendships broken through these things, or rather
these habits of running each other down!</p>

<p>We wear the mask of what we call good-breeding, which makes us unnatural
to the detriment of our real selves. We murmur conventional phrases with
our lips, give a frozen smile: shake hands in the fashion of the moment
and pass on, thinking we have done our duty to society. And yet some of
us would give worlds for an earnest sympathetic pressure of the hand,
creating a bond of good feeling which is of the greatest value and
cannot be too much prized. Do let us be natural and unaffected. It sits
badly on young or old to pretend to be what we are not. Our real selves
do not seem to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_108" id="page_108">{108}</a></span> reflected in the mirror of life; we are hidden,
distorted, just as when one looks into a common mirror. Let us hope that
physical culture and plenty of outdoor exercise will make our coming
young Australian citizens, with their finely developed bodies, a
self-reliant, broad-minded and generous race. There is no need to be
mannish: and this rubbing up against each other will make speech less
acrimonious. We can be gay at work or pleasure in this exhilarating
climate; and we must be a little serious too sometimes.</p>

<p>We should be neither proud, pandish, nor too modish. We can be a
modification of prevailing fashions, leaving extreme modes to the very
rich. Madame la mode, you know, is an expensive jade; and never mind
Mrs. Grundy, or her prototypes. Do what your conscience dictates, and be
as refined as you can; and also as kind as you can, and think of
beautiful things. The effect is wonderful. It is like studying beautiful
pictures; it gives us higher ideals; it is like walking in a lovely
garden, inhaling the fragrance of the flowers or admiring a verdant
landscape. It affects both mind and body most agreeably.</p>

<p>The classical beauties of ancient times always placed the finest
statuary in the apartments in order to inspire a sense of the beautiful
in themselves and, in turn, to their children. Likewise beautiful
thoughts will reflect themselves in our eyes, which are the mirrors of
our mind, even though we may not all be visions of beauty from an
artistic standpoint. Cultivate our minds, and care for the beautiful
“ivory temple” we call our bodies&mdash;and we shall be happy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_109" id="page_109">{109}</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="THE_LITTLE_CHILDREN" id="THE_LITTLE_CHILDREN"></a>THE LITTLE CHILDREN.<br /><br />
<small>MAKING GOOD CITIZENS.</small></h3>

<p>I wonder how many people in this world are proof against the charms of
little children. They may be small brothers and sisters of our own, the
children of our friends, or other people’s children; but we cannot fail
to love them. These darlings of the home, these small despots, claim old
and young as their vassals and worshippers. Tiny kings and queens they
in verity are, and their rule is truly autocratic. They are at once the
despair and the pride of their parents.</p>

<p>To hear that sweet “mummy and daddy,” inevitably the first words framed
by these adorable lispers, is to listen to the most melodious music. But
when we think of the many darlings&mdash;not the happy ones of our beautiful
Australia, but the unhappy little beings of the densely populated cities
of the older world&mdash;beaten, starved, neglected, born of women to whom
the real meaning of the sacred name of mother is unknown, it provides us
with food for reflection.</p>

<p>When Australia attains a population of many more millions it
will&mdash;unless, with advancing science, conditions of poverty are
ameliorated&mdash;be the same thing here. “The poor will be with us always,”
but we hope not the unkindness of ignorance.</p>

<p>Think of it! These children teeming with potentialities for good or evil
and it behoves us to think of it, though it pain us. We, in Australia
(with the exception of those who have travelled in Europe),<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_110" id="page_110">{110}</a></span> know
nothing of the grinding poverty of parts of this planet designed by the
Creator to furnish us with abundance of all that is necessary for our
subsistence.</p>

<p>But I am digressing. There is no doubt that formerly children were
brought up too strictly. But nowadays it is the reverse. The children of
to-day are frequently asked what they would like; not told what they may
have. A child should be treated very gently, yet firmly. And above all
things never promise a child a certain thing and then break that
promise. If we could only realise the after-effects of a broken promise!
Children lose their beautiful faith for ever. They have marvellous
memories, and often they become our inquisitors.</p>

<p>These little entities have their rights, and we should endeavour to
answer, and not evade their questions. We must never crush the sap of
knowledge in their little minds. Then, how often has the troubled look
on a child’s face stopped a hasty word&mdash;and the child proved the
unconscious peacemaker?</p>

<p>Have any of you ever gazed with tear-dimmed eyes upon a little waxen
figure, robed in its last fairy whiteness, noted its angelic expression,
its beautiful immobility, and not felt the sublime majesty of death! How
near the infinite it has brought us! How kind we would be if we could
feel that pulse beating with life once again!</p>

<p>If Australia is to grow into a great nation we must advance with the
times, and train those tenderest of plants, “the souls of little
children,” and inculcate in them the heroic spirit of that older Greece
in this reincarnated new Greece of southern seas. First, must we teach
the marching army of intelligent women how to love so that&mdash;“a little
child shall lead them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_111" id="page_111">{111}</a></span>”</p>

<h3><a name="MUSIC2" id="MUSIC2"></a>MUSIC.<br />
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />
<small>ITS MAGNETIC CHARM.</small><br />
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />
<small>AUSTRALIA A MUSICAL COUNTRY.</small></h3>

<p>What magnetic charm, and what wonderful effect has music upon human
beings&mdash;even upon persons who prefer to be indifferent to harmony. It
also has a marked influence upon animals and reptiles&mdash;as is well known.
Hence, the prancing of a well-bred horse at the sound of martial music,
especially if it bear a pronounced strain of Arab blood. The snake
charmers of India gain their livelihood by charming the reptiles from
their haunts. Dogs also display an intense dislike for some kinds of
music by whining dolorously. Cats and big domestic birds manifest the
same traits. But it is the ear of the “genus homo” which is the most
divinely sensitive to melody. Without possessing much special musical
ability, in classical music, we may follow the story without words. If
we are but the least little bit imaginative in the valse we may see the
grand ball-room, lovely faces of ladies, in powder and patches, courtly
men, beautiful and bizarre costumes, regal forms, flashing jewels,
coquettish glances, languid grace, the poetry of motion in the
magnificent figures&mdash;and mentally follow every phase of human emotion:
love, hope, sigh, remorse, jealousy, despair. All these are faithfully
depicted. Again, in dramatic music, without seeing the performers we
feel the revelation of pent-up passion, the force of accusative and
declama<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_112" id="page_112">{112}</a></span>tory speech. How realistic it all is; and it appeals to our
deepest feelings, as we follow the vibrating notes, now raised in shrill
tones of invectives, or lowered to tense, nerve-straining anathemas, or
terror-stricken moans. And so breathlessly we follow the music,
sympathetically, or revolting at the intensity of love or hate in the
drama. Then the final death-scene brings us back to our normal selves.</p>

<p>But more tranquilly beautiful is the pastoral theme&mdash;each kind of music
has its own individuality. We imagine the sylvan scene, the sleek kine,
the woodland, the silver stream, the soft zephyrs, the rustic lover and
the maid, the cattle knee-deep in herbage. Then a stillness. Again the
wind stirs the leaves We can almost hear them falling. Then the patter
of rain-drops, and the rising of the tempest; and at last birds trilling
their lays&mdash;and then the sun shining through the clouds.</p>

<p>Again, the “Dead March in Saul” has a deep effect on us&mdash;that beautiful
march which now and again we hear in Brisbane streets, at some military
funeral. So sad. The riderless horse&mdash;the first notes so infinitely
pathetic. The place which has known us will soon know us no more for
ever, it seems to say, and makes the most callous of us sob. Then the
sublime triumphant notes ring out telling us that the soul has discarded
the veil of flesh, and has assumed its immortal garb. So does music
speak.</p>

<p>Italy was formerly producing nearly all the stars of great magnitude,
and now Australia, which is, by reason of climatical conditions,
naturally musical, is giving to the world many beautiful singers, some
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_113" id="page_113">{113}</a></span> whom have added lustre to the Southern Cross. And note when a squad
of our defenders march at night from the barracks&mdash;how the pedestrians
quicken their steps in response to the inspiring music.</p>

<p>Vivacious music is necessary in this climate. It takes the gray colour
from our lives and elevates us by filling our ears with beautiful
sounds.</p>

<h3><a name="MAN_AND_HIS_DRESS" id="MAN_AND_HIS_DRESS"></a>MAN AND HIS DRESS.</h3>

<p>Man may consider himself unfortunate in having to endure more pain than
pleasure during the natural term of his existence on this little planet
which mortals call earth.</p>

<p>But he cannot get away from the fact that he reigns supreme as the king
of animals, and the highest of all things yet created&mdash;a beautiful
casket of mind and matter, made in the likeness of his Maker. He is
endowed with the electric unquenchable spark of immortality which can
never die. He is half animal, half spiritual and emotional, with a love
for beauty, ever longing for protection with idealistic visions of to
what he may attain&mdash;one moment plunged into transport of joy and the
love of living; the next into a vortex of despair, impotent to combat
some unexpected blow of fate, yet withal, possessing the most marvellous
courage and capacity of endurance. And amidst the vast empire of the
animal world, he stands clothed with reasoning, power, and crowned with
the majesty of knowledge, of good and evil. He alone can, of all
animals, survey the infinitude of space.</p>

<p>We know that a great gulf divides man from the lower animals, and that
between civilised man and the savage of New Guinea there is a difference
of intelligence due to environment. But, nevertheless, the savage is a
noble man in the eyes of his Creator.</p>

<p>The intelligence of a man and a lower animal differs to a tremendous
extent, although the anatomatical structure may be similar. The brain of
a man is heavier than that of an animal. Ma<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_115" id="page_115">{115}</a></span>n’s superiority depends upon
his being able to express himself by the glorious gift of speech, by
which he may exchange his thoughts and wishes, obtain the comforts
necessary to his mode of living, and build his dwelling according to the
climatic conditions of the country in which he has chosen to dwell. With
this comes another train of thought. Why, in our fair Queensland, will
the average man continue to suffer discomforts sooner than effect any
radical changes in his attire? On these days of torrid heat men are seen
in town and country wearing the conventional heavy dark coat and
waistcoat with stiff front and stiffer collar, trying to appear at
ease&mdash;while they are miserable. They will chide women for wearing
clothing which is too diaphanous, but themselves go to the other extreme
by wearing the same thickness of clothing all the year round.</p>

<p>In the early history of our race, when we ourselves were savages, we
wore iron and brass collars in token of serfdom. Then, surely, it seems
a relic of barbarism to allow a stiff collar and ugly clothes to induce
a man to a state of misery for the sake of a custom which would appear
to be inexorable as the laws of the Medes and Persians.</p>

<p>A bishop does not mind being seen in his distinctive dress and gaiters.
Why then should the average man be less brave in the matter of a
rational suite? It only needs one or two persons of influence to start
the mode and other classes would soon follow suit, to the comfort and
pleasure of all concerned. At least visitors to our shores would not
then have to discuss the martyrdom of man in the antipodes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_116" id="page_116">{116}</a></span></p>

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
